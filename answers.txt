-What were the inputs you gave the simulation? 

Virus name, reproductive rate, mortality rate, Population size, 
percent vaccinated


-What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus
burned out? 


-What percentage of the population died from the virus?
16 out of 20 died, which is 80%


-Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many
total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially
becoming infected?

Our test case was Ebola, for which there is no vaccination, so those who were "vaccinated"
became so through surviving the disease.
